# Advent of code 2019
My participation to the advent of code 2019. Each script correspond to a day (one or the two parts of the exercise). You can run each script with node.js, after installing the repository:
```
npm install
```

Before running each script, put your input in a `input` named file, at the root of the day directory.

Warning : Node.js 13.2.0 is the minimum node version required to run these scripts. You can use older versions, with the experimental ESModules support flag.
